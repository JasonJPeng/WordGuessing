# WordGuessing - NODE.JS


![demo](./source/WordGuess.gif)

This Word Guessing program is very similar to another program, [Word Game](https://jasonjpeng.github.io/WordGame/). Both programs are written in JavaScript, but this Word Guessing runs as a CLI (Command Line Interface) by using node.js whereas the Word Game runs on a browser with web interface.
